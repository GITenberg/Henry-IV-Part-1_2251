description: David Scott Kastan lucidly explores the remarkable richness and the ambitious
  design of King Henry IV Part 1 and shows how these complicate any easy sense of
  what kind of play it is. Conventionally regarded as a history play, much of it is
  in fact conspicuously invented fiction, and Kastan argues that the non-historical,
  comic plot does not simply parody the historical action but by its existence raises
  questions about the very nature of history. The full and engaging introduction devotes
  extensive discussion to the play's language, indicating how its insistent economic
  vocabulary provides texture for the social concerns of the play and focuses attention
  on the central relationship between value and political authority.
